%{
 function checks if the rank of A is equal to the number of its rows, 
which indicates that A has full row rank and hence a right inverse exists.
 It then calculates the right inverse using the formula (A' * A)^-1 * A'.
 If A doesnâ€™t have a right inverse, the function returns an empty matrix.

    else
