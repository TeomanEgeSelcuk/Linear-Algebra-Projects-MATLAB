Question 1: Given a set of data points, determine the least degree polynomial that 
fits these points. If the fitting fails, calculate a polynomial using an alternative
 method. Additionally, determine the derivative constraints and compute the general solution.

Question 2: Calculate the change of basis matrices between two bases of the vector
 space of all third-degree or less polynomials. Determine the matrix to convert from 
the standard polynomial basis to a modified polynomial basis and vice versa.

Question 3: Convert a polynomial expressed in one basis to another basis using
 a given change of basis matrix. Calculate the coefficients of the polynomial 
$P(x)=10-15x+7x^2-x^3$ in a new basis.

Question 4: Let the vector space W be all real-valued polynomials of degree 2 or
 less on the interval [-1, 1]. We define an inner product on this space by the integral
 from -1 to 1 of the product of two polynomials. This function checks if the given polynomials
 are orthogonal and finds an orthonormal basis for W.

Question 5: Calculate an orthonormal basis for the vector space of real-valued polynomials
 of degree n or less defined on the interval [-1, 1], using the inner product defined by
 the integral from -1 to 1 of the product of two polynomials.

Question 6: Determine whether a subset of a vector space is a subspace, and find
 a basis for a given subset.
